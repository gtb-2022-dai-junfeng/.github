# There Will Come Soft Rains

There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,

and swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pool singing at night,

and wild plum trees in tremulous white;

Robins will wear their feathery fire,

whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one,

will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

if mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself when she woke at dawn,

would scarcely know that we were gone.
